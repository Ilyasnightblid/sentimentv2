# sentiment
 This project aims to analyze sentiment on social media platforms by leveraging big data technologies, including Hadoop and Spark MLlib, with Java as the programming language. The application collects data from various social media sources, stores it, processes it, and applies sentiment analysis algorithms to determine public opinion on different topics. By analyzing these opinions, the project provides insights into trending sentiments and helps understand the public's stance on various issues. This can be beneficial for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers interested in analyzing public opinion across large datasets.
